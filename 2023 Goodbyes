goodbye 2023

this year, has by far been the most life-changing year i've ever lived

i never thought the trajectory of my life would change so drastically in just six month

i'm going to be honest, at the start of this year, i hated myself, i was completely and utterly insecure, it was a low point for me

i spent the first six months, desperately trying to make friends at school, and while i eventually found a friend group, i always felt like i didn't belong

in fact, i rarely ever felt like i belong, it once got so bad i had panic attacks at school almost daily

but then, one day my aunt saw an ad on instagram, a little program called JME, so she sent it to my dad, and my dad asked me if i wanted to join

i said yes

that decision, that one small decision, changed everything

i've described what it felt like entering the first ever meeting of JME that day in a previous post, so i won't get into it here, but that first meeting was amazing, it was as if i had been wearing earplugs my whole life, and i was finally able to listen clearly

from there, it was chocolate factory
and oh boy how amazing chocolate factory was, getting to spend so much time with all of my amazing friends everyday for a month, was an absolute joy ride

i'm not gonna lie though, it was tough, it was extremely tough, most night i would only get home past 12AM, and at home, i was practically constantly tired the whole month, but i'm so glad i put in the effort

Before i end the post i want to have a section dedicated to the people who have truly helped me a lot this year:
